## Challenges <br/>
### Module 1: <br/>
In the Euclidean Algorithm for GCD, the "udiv" code causes an error in the program, as it is not available in ARMv7 32-bit, based on my research. At first, I inserted a udiv code from an s file from the internet, which successfully performs the division. However, it became a challenge to integrate it into my program as it exits the program while I still have several codes to run after it. In this case, I still have to do several tweaking from that code. So, resolving the issue, I just made my own code for division based on the manual calculation.

For the Bitwise Parity Checker, it was a challenge to make a way to determine whether the parity is odd or even. I skipped the previous problem (udiv) and proceeded to this problem at first. One way to determine is to check whether the number is divisible by 2 or not. As I did not have the division code yet at the time, I just depended on the value, 1, or the least significant bit, as it is the only odd number.
